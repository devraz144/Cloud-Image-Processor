# Cloud Image Processor

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Cloud Image Processor project! This project is designed to provide a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution for processing images using AWS cloud services. By leveraging AWS S3 and AWS Lambda, we create a serverless architecture that automatically handles image processing tasks without the need for managing any servers

## Features
- Image Upload and Storage: Securely upload and store images in an AWS S3 bucket.

- Serverless Processing: Automatically trigger AWS Lambda functions upon image upload to perform various processing tasks such as resizing, filtering, and format conversion.

- Scalability: The serverless architecture ensures automatic scaling to handle varying loads.

- Cost Efficiency: AWS’s pay-as-you-go pricing model optimizes costs based on actual usage.

- Frontend Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the frontend to allow users to upload images and receive processed images directly through a web interface.

## Technologies Used
- AWS S3: For storing original and processed images.

- AWS Lambda: For serverless execution of image processing tasks.

- AWS CloudWatch: For monitoring and logging.

- Python: Primary language for Lambda functions.

- Boto3: AWS SDK for Python to interact with AWS services.

- Frontend Framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue): For building the user interface.

## Architecture

## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have:

- An AWS account with necessary permissions.

- Python installed on your computer.

- AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) configured.

- Node.jsand npm installed for frontend development.

## Installation
### Clone the repository from GitHub:

Go to the repository on GitHub and click the "Clone or download" button to get the project files.

### Install required dependencies:

- For backend: Install the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

- For frontend: Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies using npm.

## Deployment
### Set up AWS S3 bucket:

- Create an S3 bucket on the AWS Management Console.

- Update the bucket name in the Lambda function configuration.

### Deploy Lambda functions:

Use AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) or the AWS Management Console to deploy the Lambda functions.

### Deploy Frontend:

Build and deploy the frontend application. You can host it on AWS S3, AWS Amplify, or any other hosting service.

## Usage
### Upload an image:

Use the web interface to upload an image to the S3 bucket.

### Automatic processing:

The Lambda function is automatically triggered upon image upload and performs the designated processing tasks.

The processed image is then saved back to the S3 bucket.

### Receive processed image:

The web interface fetches the processed image from the S3 bucket and displays it to the user.
